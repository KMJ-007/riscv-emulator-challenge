# RISC-V Emulator Performance Analysis and Optimization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the performance analysis and optimization strategy for the RISC-V emulator. The analysis is based on profiling data and code review of the current implementation.

## Current Performance Profile

### Major Bottlenecks (Top 5)
1. Memory Write Operations (21.2% - 1.69s)
   - Location: `Executor::mw` function
   - Impact: Largest single bottleneck
   - Root Cause: Complex memory write operations with tracing and checkpointing

2. Register Loading (14.4% - 1.65s) ✅
   - Location: `Executor::load_rr` function
   - Impact: Second largest bottleneck
   - Root Cause: Frequent register access with complex state management
   - Status: Optimized with register cache implementation

3. ALU Operations (12.2% - 1.39s)
   - Location: `Executor::alu_rr` function
   - Impact: Significant CPU time
   - Root Cause: High frequency arithmetic operations with complex decoding

4. Memory Store Operations (11.8% - 1.34s)
   - Location: `Executor::store_rr` function
   - Impact: Major performance bottleneck
   - Root Cause: Complex memory operations with validation

5. Branch Operations (4.7% - 532ms)
   - Location: `Executor::branch_rr` function
   - Impact: Moderate performance impact
   - Root Cause: Branch prediction and validation overhead

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Low-Hanging Fruit Optimizations

#### 1.1 Memory Map Optimization ✅
**Original Issues:**
- Using `hashbrown::HashMap` with default hasher
- Complex address translation logic
- Frequent memory allocations
- Hash table overhead

**Implemented Solution:**
1. Replaced HashMap with Vec<Option<V>>
   - Direct indexing (O(1) access)
   - No hashing overhead
   - Better cache locality
   - Simpler implementation

2. Pre-allocated Memory
   ```rust
   pub fn new() -> Self {
       Self::with_capacity(1 << 20) // 1,048,576 entries = 4MiB
   }
   ```
   - Fixed initial size for typical workloads
   - Avoids resizing during execution
   - Matches RISC-V program needs

3. Optimized Address Translation
   ```rust
   #[inline(always)]
   fn translate_addr(addr: u32) -> u32 {
       if addr < 32 { return addr; }
       #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
       assert!(addr >= 0x10000);
       (addr - 0x10000) >> 2
   }
   ```
   - Fast path for registers
   - Direct mapping to array indices
   - No hash collisions

**Expected Impact:** 15-20% performance improvement
**Risk Level:** Low
**Implementation Status:** Completed

**Trade-offs:**
- Pros:
  - Zero hashing overhead
  - Better cache locality
  - Simpler implementation
  - More predictable access patterns
- Cons:
  - Fixed initial allocation (4MiB)
  - Memory overhead for sparse access
  - Resizing overhead for large programs
  - Requires Clone trait

#### 1.2 Register Access Optimization ✅
**Original Issues:**
- Complex register access patterns
- Frequent state validation
- Potential cache misses
- Every access going through memory map

**Implemented Solution:**
1. Added register cache
   ```rust
   pub struct Executor<'a> {
       register_cache: [Option<u32>; 32],
       register_dirty: [bool; 32],
   }
   ```
   - Fast O(1) array access
   - Small enough to fit in CPU cache
   - Tracks modified registers

2. Optimized Register Read
   ```rust
   #[inline(always)]
   pub fn rr(&mut self, register: Register, position: MemoryAccessPosition) -> u32 {
       let reg_idx = register as usize;
       if let Some(value) = self.register_cache[reg_idx] {
           return value;
       }
       // ... slow path ...
   }
   ```
   - Fast path for cache hits
   - Inlined for better performance
   - Avoids memory map overhead

3. Optimized Register Write
   ```rust
   #[inline(always)]
   pub fn rw(&mut self, register: Register, value: u32) {
       if register == Register::X0 { return; }
       let reg_idx = register as usize;
       self.register_cache[reg_idx] = Some(value);
       self.register_dirty[reg_idx] = true;
       // ... deferred update ...
   }
   ```
   - Immediate cache updates
   - Deferred memory map updates
   - Special fast path for x0

4. Register Flushing
   ```rust
   #[inline(always)]
   fn flush_register(&mut self, register: Register) {
       let reg_idx = register as usize;
       if self.register_dirty[reg_idx] {
           // ... update memory map ...
           self.register_dirty[reg_idx] = false;
       }
   }
   ```
   - Batches updates
   - Only flushes modified registers
   - Maintains correctness

**Expected Impact:** 10-15% performance improvement
**Risk Level:** Low
**Implementation Status:** Completed

**Trade-offs:**
- Pros:
  - Dramatically reduced memory operations
  - Better cache utilization
  - Simpler access patterns
  - Maintains correctness
- Cons:
  - Additional memory overhead
  - Need to track dirty state
  - More complex state management

#### 1.3 ALU Operation Optimization

- Frequent branch operations
- Redundant validations

**Proposed Solutions:**
1. Add instruction caching
2. Optimize branch prediction
3. Reduce redundant validations
4. Use lookup tables for common operations

**Expected Impact:** 5-10% performance improvement
**Risk Level:** Low
**Implementation Priority:** High

### 2. Medium-term Optimizations

#### 2.1 JIT Compilation
**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement JIT compiler for hot paths
- Cache compiled code blocks
- Optimize instruction execution

**Expected Impact:** 30-50% performance improvement
**Risk Level:** Medium
**Implementation Priority:** Medium

#### 2.2 SIMD Optimization
**Proposed Solution:**
- Use SIMD instructions
- Batch similar operations
- Optimize memory patterns

**Expected Impact:** 20-30% performance improvement
**Risk Level:** Medium
**Implementation Priority:** Medium

### 3. Long-term Optimizations

#### 3.1 Advanced Caching
**Proposed Solution:**
- Multi-level caching
- Predictive caching
- Adaptive cache sizes

**Expected Impact:** 15-25% performance improvement
**Risk Level:** High
**Implementation Priority:** Low

#### 3.2 Parallel Processing
**Proposed Solution:**
- Parallel instruction execution
- Multi-threaded memory operations
- Distributed processing

**Expected Impact:** 40-60% performance improvement
**Risk Level:** High
**Implementation Priority:** Low
